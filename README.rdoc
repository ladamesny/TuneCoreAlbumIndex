TuneCore Album Index

We distribute many songs and albums to iTunes and need a search interface for customer service. Can you design and implement a Rails app for a search interface for customer service to search our song database by any combination of song title, album title, and artist name?

Minimum Requirements

- 500 songs, 100 albums, 10 artists
- Responsive user interface
- Return a list of songs with album and artist info
- Avoid use of a off-the-shelf search libraries and platforms
- Tests

Open ended question we can talk about when youâ€™re here: What if we had 100 million songs. How might you deal with this kind of search?

Feel free to install gems. You should use bundler. Please upload the finished code to Github so we can review it.

****SUBMISSION****

My submission uses the itunes api to lookup music data such as album artwork, track times, track number and a 30 sec sample of the music.

The database stores only a name or title, and an itunes id for each model (artist, song, album). I'm using pg_search gem to search all three models' text fields for partial string matches. The api data is stored in memcached by a sidekiq worker that is run whenever the index page is loaded and only if the data wasn't cached already.

Please run the seedfile before testing the application.

Thank you
